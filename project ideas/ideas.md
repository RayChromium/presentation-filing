## ideas
  
Just rambling what I can think of now.
  
### word tagging and flashcard app?  
  
I have been learning languages using **LingQ** for a while, it looks like this: 

![learning page](img/image.png)  
  
![known word](img/image-1.png)  
  
![labling](img/image-3.png)  
  
![popular meaning](img/image-4.png)
  
![whole sentence](img/image-6.png)
  
![anki overview](img/image-2.png)  
  
![anki card](img/image-5.png)  
  
### Problems / To improve  
  
1. Need to switch between LingQ and Anki to create flash cards  
2. sentence translation not so accurate / has length limit within 9 words  
  
### Guessing the implementation?
